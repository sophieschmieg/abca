a bad computer algebra system. Don't use it. It's bad. Very bad.

I wrote this Java library because I got mad a Maple crashing during my PhD to make the exact computation that I needed at the time. I've since added algorithm that I found interesting over the years, from Buchberger's algorithm to compute a Gr√∂bner basis to point counting on elliptic curves. The performance of the library is atrocious, it is riddled with bugs and should not be used other than for personal amusement.
